Hi, I'm `Adrian </files/resume.pdf>`_, welcome to my page on the web. 

    I'm a tech enthusiast with a formal background in cybersecurity. In my free time, I enjoy windsurfing and creating art. Additionally, I'm a self-taught programmer who often spends entire afternoons reading technical documentation and books.

    The focus of this blog is on technical topics related to my area of expertise. Topics I'll be covering include network security monitoring, data analytics, web development, and systems administration.

    If you're interested in these topics, I highly recommend these books:

    - "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho, 
    - "Applied Network Security Monitoring" by Chris Sanders & Jason Smith
