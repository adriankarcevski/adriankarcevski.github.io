Hi, I'm `Adrian </files/resume.pdf>`_, welcome to my page on the web. 

    I'm a tech enthusiast with a formal background in cybersecurity. Informally I'm a self-taught programmer and trader who can spend an entire afternoon reading technical documentation and books.

    While I do enjoy other things, the focus of this blog will be on technical topics related to my area of expertise. Topics I'll be covering include network security monitoring, data analytics, web development, and systems administration.

    If you're interested in these topics, I highly recommend these books:

    - "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho, 
    - "Applied Network Security Monitoring" by Chris Sanders & Jason Smith,
